                                                <p>Booking details, which are also called categories, are the services (catering, A/V equipment, and so on), notes, attendees, activities, or room charges that you can add to a booking. Booking detail items, also called resources, are the individual items (coffee, sandwich, projector, and so on) that you add to a booking detail. When you add a resource to a booking, for example, coffee, various selections might be available or required, for example, regular, decaf, Italian roast, breakfast blend, and so on. Depending on how your EMS administrator has configured your categories, a resource might require service order times to be specified.</p>
                                                <p class="note-box">Tip: Your EMS administrator can configure buildings and categories so that a particular category can be used only in a particular building or buildings. This means that when you are adding booking details to a reservation, some booking details (categories) might not be displayed as an option.</p>
                                                <p>The booking details for a selected booking are displayed in the Booking Details pane (the lower right pane) of the Navigator.</p>
                                                <p class="note-box">Tip: Categories that contain resources, but do not require service times are referred to as "resource categories." Categories that contain resources and that require service times are referred to as "service order categories." Categories that are used to manage food service are referred to as "catering categories." Categories that are used to manage miscellaneous notes (setup notes), agenda items, attendees/visitors, or room charges are referred to as "non-resource categories."</p>

                                                <p>If the selected booking detail requires a service order or catering category, then the following four tabs are also displayed:</p>

                                                <p>Also, when you select a booking detail folder:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li value="1">Most of the tabs in the upper pane of the window have some of the basic features of an EMS Browser window. You can change the width of the data columns, you can rearrange the column order by dragging a column to a new location using the column heading, and you can sort the data columns in either ascending or descending sort order. See&#160;<a href="DC_UG_EMSWindow.html" title="An EMS Browser Window" alt="An EMS Browser Window">An EMS Browser Window</a>.</li>
                                                    <li value="2">The booking detail items for the selected booking detail are displayed in the Items pane (the lower right pane) of the Navigator. A green check mark appears in front of each individual item that has been added to a booking. If the item is a package, then a green checkmark is displayed not only in front of the package, but also, in front of each individual item in the package. A red "<span style="color: #ff0000;">X</span>" is displayed in front of any booking detail and/or booking detail item that has been deleted from a booking. The Items pane has all the features of an EMS Browser window. See&#160;<a href="DC_UG_EMSWindow.html" title="An EMS Browser Window" alt="An EMS Browser Window">An EMS Browser Window</a>.</li>

                                                <p>A booking detail might include a service order. A service order is a request to use the resource for a specified time period as opposed to using the resource for the entire event. For example, an event that meets from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm, might have food service from 11:00 am to noon. A service order consists of the service type, start and end times, and a unique, system-generated service order ID. For a catering booking detail, you can also indicate estimated count, guaranteed count, and actual count. You can create multiple service orders in the same booking. For example, you might have a number of catering services (breakfast, lunch, and afternoon refreshments) in the course of a one day training event. In this case, multiple folders are displayed under the booking folder on the left side of the Navigator window, with each folder representing a unique service order.</p>

                                                <p class="note-box">Tip: Your EMS administrator might have configured a default service type for some or all of your system's categories, but you can always select a different value. In addition, your EMS administrator might have configured states to manage your service order process. For detailed information about states, see Configuring Categories in the EMS Setup Guide.</p>
