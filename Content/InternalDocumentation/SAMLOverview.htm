        </p>
        <p>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between  an <a href="#Identity_Provider">identity provider (IdP)</a> and a <a href="#Service_Provider">service provider (SP)</a>. SAML is the link between the authentication of a user’s identity and the authorization to use a service, such as EMS&#160;Web App or EMS&#160;Mobile App. SAML&#160;provides the following authentication and authorization benefits:&#160;</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Single Sign On — Gives users the ability to log onto multiple services with the same credentials</li>
            <li>Access Control — Verifies that users have permission to access a particular service or perform a specific function in a service</li>
            <li>Federated Identity — One organization authenticating with credentials from a different organization (linking and storing a user's identity across different identity management systems) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most organizations already know the identity of their users because users are logged into their organization's domain or intranet. Through SAML, organizations can make further use of their users' identity information&#160;and log users into other web-based applications, such as  EMS&#160;Web App and EMS&#160;Mobile App.</p>
