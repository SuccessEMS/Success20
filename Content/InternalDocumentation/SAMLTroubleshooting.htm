        <p>For IdPs that require configuring the Service Provider in advance (for example, Azure AD), to determine what info to provide on the IdP side, do the following:</p>
        <p>IdP may want the base Service Provider base URL (in Service Provider Base URL for IdP Callback field in Platform Admin UI, https://mycompany.com/EmsPlatform). Or, IdP may need the full URL path (https://mycompany.com/EmsPlatform/api/v1/authentication/saml).</p>
        <p>Relay State Parameter – Extra component in redirect binding URL or extra Input Type in POST binding that remembers where the user was when user was determined to be unauthenticated and sent to the IdP. With this parameter (contains data about where the user was), once the user is authenticated by the IdP, the IdP can use the relay state parameter to send the user back to the page in the Web App that the user was taken from. In Platform SAML specification, relay state parameter is a destination URL. If IdP needs relay state parameter, just give them the Platform URL (IdP-initiated is not supported because Platform uses relay state to determine where to send user after IdP authenticates the user and sends the user back to Platform. [Maybe add to variations section] IdP-initiated SAML, wouldn’t know where to send the user: web app, mobile app, etc.)</p>

        <h3>SAML&#160;Configuration Tips</h3>
        <p>SAML issues can arise if a customer's SAML&#160;configuration information is incomplete or incorrect in the EMS&#160;Platform Services Admin UI. To verify SAML configuration, review the information found in the SAML&#160;Authentication topic, particularly the table in <a href="../Authentication/SAMLAuthen.html#Identifyyourprovider">Identify Your&#160;Provider in Configuration</a>. </p>
        <p>When verifying a customer's SAML configuration, pay close attention to the following fields of the <a href="../Authentication/SAMLAuthen.html#Identifyyourprovider">SAML&#160;Configuration</a> page of the EMS&#160;Platform Services Admin UI:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">

Attribute names can be IdP-specific, such as a user ID or email. The best way to determine what goes in this field is to <a href="#SAML_Trace">obtain a sample SAML response</a>, review the assertions, and locate the name attribute (<MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2018-10-09T09:12:46.6868269-06:00" MadCap:creator="Megan.Laub" MadCap:initials="ME" MadCap:comment="Copy the name attribute to the Identity Attribute field?

        <p>After verifying the a customer's SAML&#160;configuration in the <span class="bold">SAML </span>tab of the EMS&#160;Platform Services Admin Portal, you can set up or verify the Auth Key in the <span class="bold">Auth Keys</span>  tab. For information on setting up Auth Keys, see the <a href="../EMSPlatformServices/ConfigurationGuide/ConfigPSinAdminPortal.html#Auth">Auth Keys</a> section. </p>

        <h2><a name="SAML_Metadata"></a>SAML&#160;Metadata Import Guidelines</h2>
        <p>SAML metadata describes how each side (SP and IdP) is configured and what each side wants their requests/responses to look like. Metadata helps automate the configuration process. You do not have to configure both sides with metadata; you can configure one side manually and the other side automatically through metadata. The XML&#160;metadata file contains SAML configuration info, such as the embedded certificate, default Name ID assertion, supported binding type, and location in which to the user.</p>
        <p>EMS&#160;does not currently have a UI&#160;for importing metadata. To import IdP metadata, use a POST&#160;request through Postman (or similar tool), and POST&#160;the IdP&#160;metadata to the EMS Platform Services endpoint https://company.platform/api/v1/authentication/saml/metadata/idp.  </p>

        <p>When troubleshooting SAML configuration issues, it can be helpful to view the logs in the EMS Platform Services Admin UI. It is also helpful to perform a SAML trace, which allows you to view the SAML&#160;requests and responses.</p>

            <p>Invalid or Missing POST parameter – Looking at the SAML response from SAML-tracer can help with this error. Could be configuration issue, such as potentially be that Platform expects redirect binding and IdP sent a POST binding instead. IdP sending a parameter we don’t expect.</p>
            <p class="box-important"><span class="boldAllCaps">Important:</span> To properly troubleshoot SAML&#160;issues, you need to understand at what point in the workflow the error or issue is occurring. Try to narrow down the place in the process. For example, the user has reached the IdP already; therefore, we know the SAML request made it to the IdP and then failed. See <a href="SAML_TermsProcess.htm#SAML_Authentication_Process">SAML Authentication Process</a> to determine at which of the three SAML phases the issue is occurring.</p>
            <p>IdP may or may not need to be configured (like ADFS: needs to have URL to send users back to after user has authenticated). Platform does send URL for user redirect to the IdP and some providers don’t need any other information than the info in the request. Some need to put the info into their system (for the tested IdPs, is there a list of which require extra configuration? Then support may have potential answer for why IdP portion is causing error.). For example: Shibboleth uses URL address in request to send user back. ADFS uses the URL address in the request from Platform to verify that the address matches the URL in their system before sending user back. If URL is a location that is not configured in ADFS (valid location), ADFS will error out. Some IdPs may be automated in this process, and some may be particular and use info for verification. Same IdP could be automated and a different deployment could be more particular. Just depends on how it was set up.</p>
