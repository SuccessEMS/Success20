        <p class="body_1">The first step in the academic planning phase is to import a term. Importing an academic term consists of the following three steps:</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>A new term is created in the Student Information System (SIS), either by rolling forward a previous term, or by creating it from scratch. The term is then synchronized into EMS. See&#160;<a href="Campus_UG_44_SynchronizeAcadTerm.htm">Synchronizing an Academic Term</a>.</li>
            <li>The Domain Scheduler synchronizes course data from the SIS into EMS Academic Planning. See&#160;<a href="Campus_UG_44_SynchronizeCourses.htm">Synchronize Courses</a>.</li>
            <li>Synchronized courses are reviewed before the term is made available to academic units. See&#160;<a href="Campus_UG_44_SearchwithAcadBrowser.htm">Searching with the Academic Browser</a>&#160;and <a href="Campus_UG_44_UseCourseNav.htm">Using the Course Navigator</a>.</li>
        </ol>
