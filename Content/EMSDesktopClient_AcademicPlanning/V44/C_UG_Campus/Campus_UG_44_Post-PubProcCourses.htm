        <h1 MadCap:autonum="CHAPTER&#160;1: ">Post-Publish Processing of Courses</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />In most cases, courses are added, changed, or canceled in the SIS after the course schedule has been published in EMS. You can manually resynchronize and&#160;process&#160;these courses, or you can set options in EMS Academic Planning to automatically resynchronize these courses. After these course are automatically resynchronized, they can be automatically processed as well, or you can manually&#160;process&#160;them. Also, at the point that actual enrollment should determine room assignment (that is, can a room’s capacity handle the actual enrollment), you can&#160;process&#160;courses post-publish so that the courses are updated with the actual enrollment.&#160;</p>
        <p class="box-note"><span class="boldAllCaps">Note:</span>&#160;For automatic synchronizing to occur, the EMS Academic Planning Auto Sync Service must be installed and configured. Refer to the <a href="../../../EMSDesktopClient/V44/InstallationGuide/Introduction.htm">EMS Installation manual</a> for details.</p>

This tab displays all the new courses, new course dates, changed courses, or canceled courses from the SIS. After processing, it also lists “Room Capacity Violations,” or courses in which the designated enrollment (estimated or actual) has surpassed the capacity of the room. The Course Updates window also has a Crosslist Validation tab. When EMS changes across-list parent to accommodate a new course, course date, or change that is being processed, the cross-listed courses are displayed on the Crosslist Validation tab. The Crosslist Validation tab is for informational purposes only so that you are kept abreast of parent changes. If you are satisfied with the parent assignments, you can simply click Reviewed and the cross-listed courses are cleared from the tab; otherwise, a Set Parent option is available.</li>

        <h2>To&#160;process courses post-publish for enrollment&#160;</h2>
        <p>Typically, you publish your term in EMS prior to registration beginning. As a result, estimated enrollment is the most relevant value for searching for rooms with appropriate capacities. Closer to the start of the term, however, actual enrollment might become more relevant and you might need to change the setting so that EMS uses this value when searching for new rooms in the Navigator wizards and Course Updates window.</p>
