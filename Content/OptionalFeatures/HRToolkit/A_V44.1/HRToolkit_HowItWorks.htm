        <p>The EMS_Staging database is used to stage User records before they are imported into EMS.</p>
        <div class="box-note">
            <p><span class="bold">NOTE:</span> Your EMS database may have the <span class="italics">Groups </span>field renamed to another term, such as&#160;<span class="italics">Employees</span>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Once you have identified the data source within your organization that will be used to create and maintain your User records, you will then define and create a process to import active&#160;User records into the&#160;<span class="italics">tblPeople&#160;</span>table within&#160;<span class="italics">EMS_Staging.</span></p>
        <div class="TitleandImage">

            <p class="box-note"><span class="bold">NOTE</span>:&#160;The above is a baseline table. Please note that your table may be customized. </p>
            <p>EMS Human Resources Toolkit automates the creation, update, and de-activation of user records as individuals and as groups or contacts. EMS Human Resources Toolkit absorbs user records and any changes to these records&#160;from your chosen data source, and then transfers the data&#160;to EMS.&#160;This allows you to automatically sync EMS with user records held in other systems in your organization.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The information from your organization’s database(s) is loaded into the <span class="italics">EMS_Staging</span> database table and then the <span class="italics">HRTK_Update_Group</span> stored procedure is created on the EMS database, then executed to populate the data from the staging table into EMS.&#160;This information populates and updates the information for your EMS Groups, Contacts, and Everyday/Web Users.&#160;</p>
