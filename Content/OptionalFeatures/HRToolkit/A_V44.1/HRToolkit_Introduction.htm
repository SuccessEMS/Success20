        <p>If your organization&#160;uses an Human Resources&#160;Information System or HRIS, user and group profiles or "accounts" may already be maintained there. This toolkit eliminates the double-entry of this information, by synchronizing between your HRIS and EMS&#160;at your chosen frequency. This toolkit enables you to automate&#160;the creation, updating, and de-activation of user and group accounts in EMS. You can configure it to automatically transfer&#160;selected records to a staging database and then update&#160;the appropriate tables in EMS. This tool saves time and enhances security, and enables the creation, maintenance, and inactivation of user and group accounts from an outside data source.</p>

            <h2>How EMS&#160;HR&#160;Toolkit Integrates with User Records</h2>
            <p>EMS Human Resources Toolkit automates the creation, update, and de-activation of user records as individuals and as groups or contacts. EMS Human Resources Toolkit absorbs user records and any changes to these records&#160;from your chosen data source, and then transfers the data&#160;to EMS.&#160;This allows you to automatically sync EMS with user records held in other systems in your organization.</p>

            <p>The information from your organization’s database(s) is loaded into the <span class="italics">EMS_Staging</span> database table and then the <span class="italics">HRTK_Update_Group</span> stored procedure is created on the EMS database, then executed to populate the data from the staging table into EMS.&#160;This information populates and updates the information for your EMS Groups, Contacts, and Everyday/Web Users.&#160;</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Identify the data source(s) in your organization to use as the source for your user records.</li>
                <li>Determine if user records are organized by groups and group types (Group/Group Type Model), or all of these (Hybrid).</li>
                <li>Obtain and execute the .sql files for creating the staging database and stored procedures needed to import data into your EMS database.</li>
                <li>Establish a process for importing records into the staging database.</li>
                <li>Execute the EMS HR Toolkit stored procedure (using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to create an SQL job to run the stored procedure on a schedule).</li>
                <li>Maintain the source data to ensure continual data flow between your source(s) and EMS.</li>
