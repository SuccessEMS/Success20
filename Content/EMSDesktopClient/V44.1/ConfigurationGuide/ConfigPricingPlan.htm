        <p>A&#160;<span class="italics">pricing plan</span>&#160;bundles different&#160;rate schedules. When you&#160;configure&#160;a pricing plan, you can not only specify different rates schedules for the billable items in the plan, but also you can specify the calculation that is to be applied to a billable item when the plan is used for a group’s reservation. After you configure pricing plans, you can assign a default plan to a group’s record. Whenever a user makes a reservation for the group, the default pricing plan is displayed automatically in the Pricing Plan field on the Billing tab of the Reservation Wizard.</p>
        <p class="box-tip"><span class="boldAllCaps">TIP:&#160;</span>To help you keep track of your pricing plans and how they are used (for instance, to keep track of all your discounts),&#160;export your pricing plans&#160;periodically.&#160;</p>
