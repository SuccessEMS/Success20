            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Define Resource Selections and Selection Items</h1>
        <p>After you <a href="ConfigResourcesforCat.html">configure a resource for a category</a>, you can&#160;define&#160;selections&#160;and&#160;selection items&#160;for the resource. A&#160;selection&#160;is used when you offer choices with a resource. For example, a resource named Catered Breakfast might have the following description—Catered breakfast includes the choice of one standard entree, two sides, and assorted mini-muffins, juice, and coffee. The selection of standard entree might include the selection items of french toast, pancakes, or scrambled eggs. The side selection items might include bacon, sausage, and sliced fruit. If selection items have been defined for a resource, then an EMS Desktop Client user or an <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" />&#160;user must&#160;make a selection for the resource.</p>
        <p>To define resource selections and selection items, complete the following steps:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="number-list">
            <li>On the EMS menu bar, click <span class="bold">Configuration </span>&gt; <span class="bold">Resources</span>. A list opens of all the categories that are currently configured in your EMS database&#160;and&#160;for which you can configure resources.</li>
            <li>Select the category for which you are configuring the resources. The Resources window opens. This window lists all the resources that are currently configured in your EMS database for the selected category and that have a status of <span class="bold">Active</span>.</li>
        </ol>

            </p>
        </div>
        <ol start="3" class="number-list">
            <li>Optionally, do one or both of the following:<ul start="3"><li>To view all resources for the category in your EMS database, regardless of status, under Show, click <span class="bold">Inactive</span>.</li><li>To filter the displayed resources based on the Resource name, in the Filter field, enter a search string.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="box-tip"><span class="boldAllCaps">Tip:&#160;</span>The search string is not case-sensitive, but your search is limited to the exact order of the characters in the string and it must begin with the information for which you are searching. For example, a search string of&#160;Cold&#160;returns&#160;Cold&#160;Boxed Lunches, but not Sandwiches (Cold).</p>
        <ol start="4" class="number-list">
            <li>Select the resource for which you are configuring the selections, and then click <span class="bold">Selections</span>. The Selections window opens. This window lists all the selections that have been configured for the selected resource and that have a status of <span class="bold">Active</span>.</li>
