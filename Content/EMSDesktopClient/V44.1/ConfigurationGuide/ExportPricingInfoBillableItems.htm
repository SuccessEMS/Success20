        <p>After you configure a rate schedule and define the pricing for the billable items (rooms and resources) in the rate schedule, you can&#160;export&#160;the pricing information on the Edit Pricing window. The information is exported to a Microsoft Excel file.</p>
        <p class="box-note"><span class="boldAllCaps">Note:</span>&#160;You do not need Microsoft Excel on your EMS client to export the information to the file; however, you must have Microsoft Excel on your EMS client to view the file. You can also export the pricing information for rooms and resources after you have configured the information for the room or resource.
