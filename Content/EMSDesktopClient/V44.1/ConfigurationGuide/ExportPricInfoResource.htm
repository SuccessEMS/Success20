            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Export Pricing Information for a Resource</h1>
        <p>You can&#160;export&#160;any pricing information that you have configured for a resource on a per rate schedule basis from the Edit Pricing window. The information is exported to a Microsoft Excel file.</p>
        <p class="box-note"><span class="boldAllCaps">Note:</span>&#160;You do not need Microsoft Excel on your EMS client to export the information to the file; however, you must have Microsoft Excel on your EMS client to view the file. You can also export the pricing information for rooms and billable items after you have configured the information for the room or resource. See&#160;also: <a href="ExportPricInfoRoom.htm">Export Pricing Information for a Room</a> and&#160;<a href="ExportPricingInfoBillableItems.htm">Export Pricing Information for Billable Items</a>.</p>

                <p>After you define your organization’s rate schedules, you have three options for&#160;manually&#160;assigning the prices to billable items (rooms and resources) based on these schedules:</p>
                <ol class="number-list">
                    <li><span class="bold">During the configuration of a room or resource.</span> When you are configuring a <a href="ConfigRooms.html">room</a> or <a href="ConfigResourcesforCat.html">resource</a>, the configuration dialog box contains a <span class="bold">Pricing </span>tab. This tab lists all the rate schedules that are currently configured in your EMS database. You can specify the pricing method for the billable item that you are configuring for each rate schedule. You can also specify a discount percentage for the item, a minimum charge for the item, a maximum charge for the item, or any combination of these options.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">After all necessary rooms and resources are configured.</span> Both the <a href="ConfigRoomPricing.htm">Rooms</a> window and the <a href="ConfigPricingResourceEditPriceWin.htm">Resources</a> window contain a <span class="bold">Pricing </span>button. You can click <span class="bold">Pricing </span>to open an Edit Pricing window. You can use the options on this window to specify the pricing method for the billable items (rooms and resources) for a selected rate schedule. You can also specify a discount percentage for the item, a minimum charge for the item, a maximum charge for the item, or any combination of these options.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">When rate schedules are defined. </span>The <a href="ConfigRateSchedule.htm">Rate Schedules</a> window has a <span class="bold">Pricing </span>button. After you have defined a rate schedule, you can select a rate schedule in the Rate Schedules window and click <span class="bold">Pricing </span>to open an Edit Pricing window. You can use the options on this window to specify the pricing method for every billable item for the rate schedule. You can also specify a discount percentage for the item, a minimum charge for the item, a maximum charge for the item, or any combination of these options. </li>
