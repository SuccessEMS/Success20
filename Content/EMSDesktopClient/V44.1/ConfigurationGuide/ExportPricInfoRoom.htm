            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Export Pricing Information for a Room</h1>
        <p>You can export any pricing information that you configure for a room on a per rate schedule basis on the Edit Pricing window. The information is exported to an Excel file.</p>

You can also export the pricing information for resources and billable items after you have configured the information for the room or resource. See&#160;also: <a href="ExportPricInfoResource.htm">Export Pricing Information for a Resource</a> and&#160;<a href="ExportPricingInfoBillableItems.htm">Export Pricing Information for Billable Items</a>.</p>
