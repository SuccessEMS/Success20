        <p>Even though the Change Booking Status Wizard is available for changing the status of multiple bookings in a reservation, most reservationists who approve reservations that are submitted from Web App do so by using the Change Status function that is available on the Reservation Summary tab in the Navigator. This is because unlike the Change Booking Status Wizard, when you use the Change Status function in the Navigator to&#160;change&#160;the status of a reservation, an option is available for automatically generating and sending a confirmation to the group for whom the reservation was made.</p>
        <p class="box-tip"><span class="boldAllCaps">Tip: </span>Your EMS administrator must grant you the appropriate security access to change the status of a booking, which includes canceling a booking. If you want to change the status of a booking using the Change Booking Status Wizard, see&#160;<a href="EditMultBookinNav.htm">Editing Multiple Bookings in the Navigator</a>.</p>
        <p class="box-tip"><span class="boldAllCaps">Tip:</span> An email can be automatically generated and sent only if Email is selected for the Confirmation setting on the General tab of the Navigator Options dialog box, and if the group for which the reservation was made has an email address in its record.
