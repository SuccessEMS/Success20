        <p>If you want to remove an item from a booking (and it has not already been invoiced), you can use the Delete Item Wizard to&#160;delete&#160;it. You can delete one item at a time&#160;or you can&#160;all the items for a booking detail. If you delete an item at the package level, this includes&#160;all the items in the package. You can also delete individual items from a package.</p>
