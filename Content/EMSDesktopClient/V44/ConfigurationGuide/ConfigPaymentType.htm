            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Configure Payment Types</h1>
        <p>A&#160;payment type&#160;indicates the forms of payment that your organization accepts. Payment types are also used to track the forms of payment that your groups are using. Examples of payment types include checks, credit card, and cash. Because payment types are for informational purposes only and do not affect the pricing or billing of an event, configuration of payment types is not required; however, after you&#160;configure&#160;payment types, you can assign a default payment type to a group’s record. Whenever a user makes a reservation for the group, the default payment type is displayed automatically in the Payment Type field on the Billing tab of the Reservation Wizard.</p>
