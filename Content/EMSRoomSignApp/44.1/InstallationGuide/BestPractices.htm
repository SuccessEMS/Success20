        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.RSA" /> (formerly named EMS Glance) is an optional web-based application that turns your tablet (e.g., iPad, iPad mini, etc.) into a digital room sign.  The EMS Room Sign App  gives users real-time information and at-a-glance availability for their meeting, learning, and working spaces. </p>

        <h2><a name="Considerations"></a>Considerations </h2>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>You need to know when the <MadCap:variable name="General.RSA" /> stops running by receiving an email notification (ideally), or by watching a central monitoring display. EMS does not provide this capability, therefore you should physically check your tablets to see if <MadCap:variable name="General.RSA" /> has stopped.</li>
            <li>For the tablets running the EMS Room Sign App, you will want notification of battery failure, lost connectivity, or necessary updates to the operating system. EMS does not detect these conditions remotely; therefore, we recommend implementation of a Mobile Device Management (MDM) system.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>If the iPad's battery dies, the iPad will return to its home screen after you restore power. At that point, you must configure Guided Access again for the EMS Room Sign app.  See <a href="../UserGuide/RSA_UG_DeployingonTablet.html">Deploy [%=General.RSA%] on Tablets</a> for more information.</li>
            <li>If a user presses the iPad's Home button, Guided Access displays a passcode screen. The screen disappears after fifteen seconds or if the user clicks 'Cancel.' </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="box-note"><b>NOTE</b>:&#160;Users should not be able to press any tablet buttons if using a tablet enclosure.</p>
        <ol class="number-list" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>If a user presses both the iPad's Home and Sleep/Wake buttons simultaneously for 10 seconds, the iPad restarts. At that point, you must configure Guided Access again for the EMS Room Sign app.  See <a href="../UserGuide/RSA_UG_DeployingonTablet.html">Deploy [%=General.RSA%] on Tablets</a> for more information. </li>
        </ol>

        <ol class="number-list" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>iOS devices occasionally display notifications that a software update is available. There is no way to suppress update notifications. When this notification appears, the user can choose "Later" but the notification will appear again in 24 hours. If the user chooses "Install Now," the iPad downloads and installs the update and then restarts. At that point, you must configure Guided Access again for EMS Room Sign.  See <a href="../UserGuide/RSA_UG_DeployingonTablet.html">Deploy [%=General.RSA%] on Tablets</a> for more information.</li>

        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>Ideally, a tablet will be dedicated to the EMS Room Sign App and will not be used for anything else. However, Android provides no capability to lock down the tablet in a way that's suitable for the EMS Room Sign App. Therefore, EMS&#160;Software recommends deploying the EMS Room Sign App with an Android app that places the tablets in 'kiosk' mode. Placing the tablet in kiosk mode prevents users from accessing other applications and disables the 'Home' button. EMS&#160;Software recommends that you purchase, install, and configure the&#160;<a href="https://www.kioware.com/kwl_android.aspx">Kioware Lite</a>&#160;app.</li>
            <li>If you run the EMS Room Sign App on a Samsung Tab A, users can power off the tablet by holding down the Power button. If you have configured Kioware <a href="../UserGuide/RSA_UG_DeployingonTablet.html#ConfigureKioskModeAndroid">according to our recommendations</a>, the EMS Room Sign App will restart as soon as the tablet is powered on. To prevent users from pressing the 'Home' button, user the <a href="RequirementsforRSA.html#EMSRoomSignApp">appropriate enclosure</a>. </li>
