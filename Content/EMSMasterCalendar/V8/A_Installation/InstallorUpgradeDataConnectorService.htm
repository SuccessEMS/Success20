        <h1>Install / Upgrade EMS&#160;Data Connector Service</h1>
        <p>Prior to installing or upgrading the EMS&#160;Master Calendar Data Connector Service, be sure the EMS Data Connector Script has been executed against the EMS Database(s).  (See <a href="ExecuteDataConnectorScript.htm">Executing the EMS Data Connector Script.)</a></p>
        <p>The optional Data Connector Service for the EMS&#160;Master Calendar System can be used to create a connection between an EMS Database and a calendar in the Master Calendar system.  </p>
        <p>Data Connectors can also be used to import tab delimited and XML files (see “Installing or Upgrading the Master Calendar Import Service”).  The Data Connector Service must be installed on a machine that is connected to the network and is running every day.  The Data Connector Service is often installed on the database server or the web server.</p>
        <h2>Install the Master Calendar Data Connector Service</h2>
        <p class="note-box">Important:  Existing versions of the EMS&#160;Master Calendar Data Connector Service must be manually uninstalled, through the <span class="bold">Add or Remove Programs</span> menu, prior to upgrading the EMS&#160;Master Calendar Data Connector Service to a newer version.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the DEAMasterCalendarDataConnectorSetup.msi onto the server that will be running the service.</li>
            <li>2. Double-click DEAMasterCalendarDataConnectorSetup.msi. Follow the on-screen prompts.  It is recommended that the defaults are accepted.</li>
