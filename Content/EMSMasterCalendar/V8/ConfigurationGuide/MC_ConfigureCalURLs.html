            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Configure Calendar URLs</h1>
        <p class="Body">A <em>calendar U</em><em>RL</em> provides a shortcut for your guests or users to navigate to calendars in Master Calendar. For example, a user can specify one or more calendars in your system for which they want to view events, the specific type of event to view on these calendars, and for a specific event type, only those event types that take place at a specific location. A URL can be for a single calendar or it can be for a calendar that combines the events from multiple calendars. This topic guides you in creating&#160;a calendar URL and editing existing calendar URL.</p>
        <p class="Body">When you are adding a calendar URL, the fields that appear on the URL page are determined by what is currently configured and active in Master Calendar. For example, if you do not have any event types currently configured and active in Master Calendar, then the Event Types dropdown list is not displayed on the URLs page. The following procedure is shown with all the available options for adding a calendar URL.&#160;To configure optional information such as event types, see&#160;<a title="Configuring Optional Information" href="MC_ConfigOptionalInfo.html" alt="Configuring Optional Information">Configuring Optional Information</a>.</p>
