        <p>You can manage events from the <a href="#ManageEventsSummary">Event Summary page</a> or through the <a href="#ManageEventsManageEvents">Manage Events page</a>. </p>
        <h2><a name="ManageEventsSummary"></a>Manage Events from the Event Summary Page</h2>
        <p>From the Manage Events page, or the <strong>Edit </strong>icon on the Event Details page, double click on an event to open the Event Summary page. The <strong>Details </strong>tab on this page summarizes the current details for the event. The <strong>History </strong>tab displays the history for the event. In addition, the Event Summary page has three tabs that show the dates that are associated with the event:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>All </strong>tab shows all currently active dates for the event in Master Calendar. (The information that appears on this tab is the combined information from the Current tab and the Historical tab.) </li>
            <li>The <strong>Current </strong>tab shows recurring dates for the event going forward from the current day’s date.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Historical </strong>tab shows recurring dates that have already posted.</li>

To manage events with different statuses, you must refine this list by filtering it by&#160;specific criteria.</p><p class="box-note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>For all procedures in this section, you must be logged in either as a Calendar Manager or as the site administrator. If you are logged in as the Calendar Manager, or the site administrator, you can always open the event by clicking the event title on the Manage Events page. You can then easily review the event specifics as well as edit the event details.&#160;<strong>See Also:&#160;</strong><MadCap:xref href="../UserGuide/MC_UG_TypesofUsers.html">Types of EMS&#160;Master Calendar Users.</MadCap:xref></p></body>
