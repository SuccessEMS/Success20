        <h1 MadCap:autonum="CHAPTER&#160;1: ">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) (EU) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union. It addresses the export of personal data outside the EU. The GDPR aims primarily to give control back to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. When the GDPR takes effect, it will replace the 1995 Data Protection Directive.</p>
        <p>GDPR applies to any organization operating within the EU, as well as any organizations outside of the EU which offer goods or services to customers or businesses in the EU. That ultimately means that almost every major corporation (including EMS Software) in the world will need to be ready when GDPR comes into effect, and must start working on their GDPR compliance strategy.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of GDPR, not only will organizations have to ensure that personal data is gathered legally and under strict conditions, but those who collect and manage it will be obliged to protect it from misuse and exploitation, as well as to respect the rights of data owners - or face penalties for not doing so.</p>
        <p>This topic will provide information on the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Data</li>
            <li>Processors and Controllers</li>
            <li>GDPR&#160;and EMS&#160;Software</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Personal Data</h2>
        <p><span class="bold">Personal data</span> under the existing legislation include name, address, and photos. GDPR extends the definition of personal data so that data such as an IP address would be considered personal data. It also includes sensitive personal data—such as genetic data or biometric data—that could be processed to uniquely identify an individual.</p>
        <p>This applies directly to EMS Cloud Services. </p>
        <h2>Processors and Controllers</h2>
        <p>There are two different types of data-handlers the legislation applies to: <span class="bold">processors</span> and <span class="bold">controllers</span>. For more information, please see  <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf">General Data Protection Regulation</a>.</p>
        <h3>Processors</h3>
        <p>The processor is person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>
        <h3>Controllers</h3>
        <p>The controller is the person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing of personal data.</p>
        <h2>GDPR and <MadCap:variable name="General.My Company" /></h2>
        <p>By design, EMS Software is complaint with the known standards of GDPR. EMS does not capture any personal ‘people’ data, beyond the reasonable information to respond and uniquely identify. Typically, this includes an email address and name. The reservation data that EMS uses is provisioned from an organization's election of data, and is not within the control of EMS Software. </p>
        <p>EMS Software only accepts the data that is provided from the organization’s HR source, and will not require that information to function. GDPR compliance lies mainly with the eradication of data upon exit of a software suite or website; as EMS is driven by the user’s data provided at the HR source, it is also managed by that source. HR data systems hold the responsibility of releasing and removing the data from record. When this is done, our own system will no longer have that data accessible to the product. </p>
        <p>Historical data within EMS for the purpose of reporting typically generalizes or ‘groups’ user data together in factored percentages and usage, and does not include ‘named’ users. In the exception, where named users are listed (invoicing and responsible party), there are legal considerations that allow for this to continue to (by organizational choice) exist in the product.</p>
