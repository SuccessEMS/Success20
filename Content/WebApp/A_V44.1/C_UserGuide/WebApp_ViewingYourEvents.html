            <li>Click&#160;<span class="bold">My Events&#160;</span>to see your reservations and bookings.&#160;The default view for My Events is dependent on the configuration done by your EMS&#160;Administrator.

In addition, EMS will return search results that contain your search string regardless of where those characters appear. For example, a search string of ed returns the College of Education Seminar, Ed Smith fundraiser, Health Center Education Training, and so on.</p></div><div class="note-box note"><p><span class="bold">NOTE</span>: The <span class="bold">BROWSE &gt; EVENTS</span> menu option shows  all of your reservations, as well as all reservations that you are authorized to view.
